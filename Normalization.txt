
Unnormalized Data (UNF) Example
Consider a single table holding everything:


OrderID	CustomerName	Email	Phone	EventName	EventDate	VenueName	TicketType	Price	Quantity
1 Chris Johns	john@email.com	555-5555	Concert A	2025-10-01	Music X Arena 	VIP, LA	100,50	1,2
This table violates all three normal forms.

First Normal Form (1NF)
Rule: No repeating groups, atomic values only.

Split multiple values in TicketType, Price, Quantity:
Orders


OrderID	CustomerName	Email	Phone	EventName	EventDate	VenueName
1	Chris Johns	john@email.com	555-5555	Concert A	2025-10-01	Music X Arena
OrderItems


OrderID	TicketType	Price	Quantity
1	VIP	200	1
1	GA	100	2
Second Normal Form (2NF)
Rule: No partial dependencies (i.e., all non-key attributes depend on the full primary key).

We separate data into distinct entities and move data that depends only on part of a composite key into its own table.

Entities:
Customers


CustomerID	Name	Email	Phone
1	Chris Johns	john@email.com	555-5555
Venues


VenueID	Name	Address	Capacity
1	Music X Arena 	[Address]	[Cap]
Events


EventID	Name	Date	VenueID
1	Concert A	2025-10-01	1
Tickets


TicketID	EventID	Type	Price	QuantityAvailable
1	1	VIP	100	150
2	1	GA	50	500
Orders


OrderID	CustomerID	OrderDate	TotalAmount
1	1	2025-04-20	200
OrderItems


OrderItemID	OrderID	TicketID	Quantity	PricePerTicket
1	1	1	1	200
2	1	2	2	100
Third Normal Form (3NF)
Rule: No transitive dependencies
We separate data into distinct entities and move data that depends only on part of a composite key into its own table.
We already achieved 3NF by separating:

Venue details from events

Customer details from orders

Ticket details from order items

Prices are stored only in Ticket and copied into OrderItems for record keeping.

3NF is the final normal form and can be found on ERD diagrams.
